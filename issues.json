I still can't find a case where a server could decide to emit this code without being absolutely certain the client would be able to retry. The biggest problem I'm seeing is that SHOULD NOT will be enough of a signal for some dirty server implementations to use it to force a generic retry (eg: flow control) and that will force clients to implement support for it, diverting the initial purpose. So better use MUST NOT."

    "body": "\"An intermediary MUST NOT add this header field with a value of “0” or remove a header field if it has a value of “1”\" : I see the point in case a request is transported over several gateways, but then it conflates the client's initial intent and what the next hope received. For example, it might be complicated for a client to remove this header field at the last moment once the connection is being established and the server says it doesn't accept early data. So the client might leave some early-data header fields in its request buffer and send them over a perfectly safe connection. But at the same time we don't want to let second or third level gateways remove the header field. I think in fact we need 3 values for the header field, the one used by the client and the one passed to the server. We want more or less \"Early-data: sent\" set by the client, replaced with \"Early-data: received\" by the first gateway, or the header field being removed (or set to \"none\") if in the end the request was not received as early data. And only \"sent\" would be allowed to be replaced, with \"received\" being sticky. I can propose some text."

    "body": "\"This gives a client explicit control over whether a given request is exposed to the risk of replay.\"\r\n\r\nFor me the first risk the client takes by sending a request as early data is to see it being rejected and having to retry it differently. It's important because it helps decide whether or not idempotent requests should be sent this way or not, regardless of the replay risk.\r\n\r\nIn fact I *think* that if we place the replay avoidance paragraph before \"reducing the risk\", we may more easily enumerate the double risk the client has to accept to take (request being replayed, request getting rejected by the server)."
